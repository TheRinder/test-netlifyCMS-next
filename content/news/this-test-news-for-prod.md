Oral transmission is the oldest method of knowledge transmission in the history of mankind. After ancient civilisations invented writing systems, people began to use almost anything they could write on - clay tablets, wood bark, sheets of metal, etc.
Tablets
Sumerian clay tablet with cuneiform writing

A tablet can be defined as a physically sturdy, robust medium for written information and relatively easy to use and transport in everyday life. The writing tool used here was usually a stylus. Two main types of plates can be distinguished: clay tablets which were often used for writing cuneiform inscriptions\[4] (for example, in the valley between the Tigris and the Euphrates) and wax tablets. The latter were tablets covered with a layer of wax, while clay tablets consisted entirely of clay and were often fired after the inscription to give them additional strength. After this procedure, it was impossible to change the text; on the contrary, inscriptions on wax tablets could be erased and reused. In Ancient Rome plaques were often stapled together. It is known that there were diptychs, triptychs and polyptychs (two, three and many planks respectively)\[5], which formed a kind of prototype of a modern book, a codex\[6].
The scrolls

In ancient Egypt, papyrus (a type of paper made from the stalks of a plant of the same name) was used for recording, from the time of the First Dynasty. However, the first evidence is considered to be the account books of King Neferirkare Kakya of the Fifth Dynasty (about 2400 BC). Individual sheets of papyrus, for ease of storage, were glued into scrolls. This tradition was widespread in the Hellenic and Roman worlds, although there is evidence that tree bark\[7] and other materials were also used. The technology of making papyrus was described by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History (XIII. 11-13)\[8]. According to Herodotus (History 5:58), the Phoenicians brought writing and papyrus to Greece around the 10th or 9th century B.C. The Greek word for papyrus as a recording material was "biblion" and for book was "biblos"\[9] which came from the name of the Phoenician port city Byblos, through which papyrus was exported to Greece\[10].
