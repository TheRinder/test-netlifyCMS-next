## Internal Audit - business overseer



One of the most important areas, which is frequently being neglected is internal audit. Continuously conducting appropriate internal audits helps prevent gigantic (tremendous) losses related to insufficient/deficient internal controls. Internal audit encompasses fraud risk assessment, implementation of internal controls. 



We fully utilize our core value of independence to critically reassess the client's vision on internal risks and control environment, considering all the relevant and current regulations and standards.



We have developed a unique approach to performing internal audit, namely the Circon’s IA model entrenched at effective substantive testing of controls and value-based internal audit:

1. Focusing on strategic vision
2. Dynamic approach to risk assessment (changing environment)
3. Continuous monitoring
4. Engaging emerging technology - advanced data analytics, process automation
5. Internal audit AI (in development)
6. Laconic but in-depth report



We also prepare our output in accordance with the 5 C’s rule:



1. Criteria: What particular issue was identified, and why was the internal audit necessary? Is the internal audit in preparation for a future external audit? Who requested the audit, and why did this party request the audit?
2. Condition: How was the issue in relation to a company target or expectation? Does the company have a policy that was broken, a benchmark that was not met, or other condition that was not satisfied? Is the company confident no issue exists, or do they believe an issue is at hand?
3. Cause: we identify the cause of the issue and the persons involved
4. Consequence: What is the outcome of the problem? Are issues limited to internal matters, or are there risks of external consequences? What is the financial implications of the issue?
5. Corrective Action: What can the company do fix the problem? What specific steps will management take to resolve the issue, and what type of monitoring or review will occur after solutions have been put in place to ensure a fix has been implemented?
