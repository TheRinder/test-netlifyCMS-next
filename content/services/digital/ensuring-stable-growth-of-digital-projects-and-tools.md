Circon’s BISHOP approach for digital solutions. 

**BISHOP - Boundless Innovation Secures Harmony and Ongoing Prosperity**



Our digital consulting encompasses: 



**Digital optimization and automatization (modernization)** - we make the future closer for our clients. By use of advanced (sometimes emerging) technological solutions and our interindustrial experience, we optimize the operational activity in various ways. 



**Digitalization strategy** - Driving and following technological evolution requires thorough and seamless strategy, which helps harness all the benefits of the digital era! Digitalisation is not a point-in-time action. It requires constant transformation and adaptation, as well as being sustained through capabilities. We are focusing on modernizing the core technology and harnessing data analytics capabilities. Our strategy encompasses modernizing supply-chains through technologies, increasing revenue (digital sales, e-commerce, personalization, customer loyalty) and raising marketing efficiency.



**Digital audit (UX-audit)** - a document that includes advised adjustments necessary to optimize the website and improve customer experience. More loyal audience and better conversion (potential -> real customers).



Data protection advisory - our experienced specialists are able to solve GDPR and data safety related issues. By way of using advanced technological solutions in the area of data protection, we advise our clients and help them implement the solutions. We treat our client’s data as our own!
