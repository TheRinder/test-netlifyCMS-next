Are you an investor looking for specialists to identify whether your object of investment operates transparently and doesn´t tolerate “dirty money”?



Are you a shareholder who suspects your company's management of lack of transparency or unusual activity, and wants to keep the money in your company?



Are you a member of the management board who wants to ensure that the company has an appropriate anti-fraud control environment and is compliant with the AML legislation?



According to the latest survey performed by PwC, almost 1 of 2 companies experienced fraud, corruption or other economic crimes in the last 2 years.



Our AML specialists and auditors are on duty to fulfill everyone’s needs!



One of our core values is independence, which, combined with our operational transparency, allows us to identify maximum non-compliances and indications of fraud. We focus on professional skepticism, while performing AML analysis, maximizing our alertness to conditions which may indicate possible misstatement due to fraud or management override of controls. 



There are basically several major types of internal fraud:

1. Asset misappropriation
2. Accounting/financial statement fraud
3. KYC failure (which is external as well)
4. Procurement fraud
5. Supply chain fraud



When performing AML and fraud related tasks we rely on our Circular Methodology:
