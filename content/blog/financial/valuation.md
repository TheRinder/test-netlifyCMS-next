The cornerstone of successful and fair transactions - Circon’s Valuation Hub. 



From M&A transactions to individual financial instruments valuations - Circon’s Valuation Hub will select the relevant valuation method and determine the fairest value possible, matching the client’s expectations and individualities. 



What is the fair price for the seller and the buyer? Which capitalisation interest rate is achievable on the market? What is the intrinsic or relative value of your company? What is the true fair value of your financial instrument (Commodity Swap, non-public security, mortgage derivative, digital asset)? Is there a possibility to increase the value (for the seller) or decrease (for the buyer)? Is the seller asking for a fair price?



Our clients can also rely on us after completing a transaction: We support you in identifying and taking advantage of potential ways of increasing your company’s value. Our business model allows us to offer you all related services, which makes it affordable and increases quality. We combine our accumulated industry knowledge with professional tools to bring you to the greatest outcome possible!
