The only way to operate in a highly regulated environment - the technology of corporate & commercial law.



Nemo censetur ignorare legem

Ius est ars boni et aequi - Roman People



We are initially determined to carry out legal work outside of judicial procedures. What does it mean? It is very important to approach work with a certain planning, with an understanding of what the client wants and show how this or that procedure takes place. Circon’s offer corporate and commercial services from the simple start and maintenance of companies to specific structured projects. The assistance of the team contributes to the professional development of the project, which is subject to regulatory action and a quality attitude to detail makes it secure in times of corporate change.

* ### Sale or purchase of a company

M&A deals are always accompanied with a ton of mandatory documentation, which should be professionally and correctly processed and organized. We are able to support you on the legal side all the way through the process. 



What is necessary?

Accounting/book keeping is in order, Annuals reports have been submitted, Corporate taxes have been declared and paid, A confirmation of balances has been obtained from debtors, Liabilities have been cleared, Due diligence by an auditor or a lawyer has been conducted.

​​We organise the sale or purchase of the company quickly and easily!



* ### Liquidation of a company 

The reasons for winding up a company are many and it must be clearly understood that all debts, reports and accounts are perfect. We look at the business situation and conclude on the action to be taken! 

The liquidation work, which takes in the region of 7-8 months, we take over completely. 



According to the Estonian Commercial Code, a company must appoint at least one liquidator whose physical place of residence is in Estonia. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that companies can be held liable in the event of any pending cases and that the interests of creditors are protected.



During the liquidation procedure, the company is not allowed to continue its normal business operations, except for the sale of assets, the settlement of debts and the settlement of claims. The company will be marked as a company in liquidation.



* ### Regular documentation



Our experts have decent knowledge in preparing all the necessary documentation coming from the regular business operations. Contracts, agreements, standard documentation. 



Why is it important?



Firstly, well-drafted documents have a positive impact both on the work of the company itself and on all sorts of government agencies. 

Secondly, the obligation to draw up documents in accordance with the procedures of the commercial management structures in the country, has a high impact on the whistle-blowing nature of the company's intentions.



Therefore, from a professional point of view, it is always an important step towards a quality approach to work. 



* ### Corporate reorganization

If you need to reorganise your business: e.g. from a Limited Liability Company to a Joint-stock Company Circon’s professionals are able to assist you with all the required documentation and applications. 



Every step that requires reorganisation must be:



* Qualitatively processed
* Reassessed at long-term value
* Practically understood
