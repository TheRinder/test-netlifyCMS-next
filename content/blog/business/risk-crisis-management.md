**There is no better Business medicine than this.**

Appropriate risk management is the basis for a company to operate effectively and maintain stable growth. Especially today, when the economic environment is extremely turbulent. Circon’s experts perform in-depth analysis to assess and challenge the client’s vision on the internal and external risk environment. 

Some events cannot be predicted and assessed beforehand, as well as totally prevented. In that case, Circon’s team is able to fight the consequences of a negative effect, ensuring the entity's continuing existence and prosperity. 

Our approach to assessing and addressing the risk environment is developed based on our Circular Methodology “GETUP”:

### How do we help?

### Our approach helps our clients to see all pros and cons of actions of a company in the time of crisis or risk situations. Therefore we offer our model “GETUP” that is 100% finds usage in pre- and critical situations.

**Get acquainted.**

We get the overview of the company. It starts from the product nature and strategy that company uses. As usual, we try to know the situation fully, which will be able to show us the main points. Each piece of information gives us fodder for developing a particular formulation of the work. Appreciating the team's attention and knowledge, we want to be the face of our customers' trust.

**Explore it.**

We overview the problematic places and actions of the company. It is vital, since solution is usually finds out from the concrete issue, from the smallest detail. Team deals with it on the basis of observance.  

**Think on it**

Taking into account the details, we pay attention to distribution and planning. The main tasks consist of a goal, a plan and a result. Thinking in the meantime is not a waste of time, instead our team uses the 20/80 method, in which 20 core knowledge and logically constructed path models produce a staggering 80 percent jump in results. 

**Utilize it** 

The process of solution is almost done! Everything that we need to make is to structure the data. The structure of all information is a logically and innovatively constructed phase in which moments of result are reunited into a single result. What is truly a great result is that this model contributes not only to surviving in crisis and risky situations, but also leads to the development of the company as a whole. 

**Practice it** 

All that remains to do is to get a positive result based on the integration and keep an eye on the indicators. As we said earlier, the details are most important!
