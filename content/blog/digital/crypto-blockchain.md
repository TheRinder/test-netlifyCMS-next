BLOCKCHAIN AUDIT \*PRIMARY SERVICE\*



You, as investor, you, as a crypto entrepreneur, you, as a government authority - are all interested in cryptocurrencies to be safe.



As of today, the industry has been tremendously turbulent in terms of fraud and cybersecurity. 



These are the reasons why cryptocurrencies should be audited.



But how, if it’s autonomous and regulated by a protocol?



Our specialists in synergy with proper technology have developed a unique approach to the audit of blockchain protocols. Firstly, a fully automated data-backed robot skims through a protocol and identifies whether there are any weak spots in the structure of the protocol. Our specialists then review the work performed and scan the protocol deeper. Such a method saves our clients’ time and money, as well as mitigates human factors.\
